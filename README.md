# InstantOpen
A way to instantly open the workspace that you desire. WIP

Have you ever wanted to open vscode, the terminal, and your favorite coding website, and configure them, side by side, just the way you want, but it's kinda annoying? Now you can simply press a singlebutton to open your workspace of choice.

# Dependencies:
Please check the requirements.txt. Note: It may not include all dependencies.`

# How to use:
1. Make sure you have all the dependencies installed.
2. There is a config directory in both the dist directory and the actual project folder itself. These need to match, for example if you have a config1.txt file you need it in both config folders.
3. Once you have all these things set up, make sure you are on windows. Open up powershell, navigate to the project, and run the instantOpen script.
4. This will compile all the exe files based on your config.txts. You will see the exe files show up in the dist folder.
